# Silicon Labs Application Examples Community #

## Introduction

- Introduce about old Application Examples
- Reason why do we have this additional Sandbox workspace

This repo contains example applications developed by Silicon Labs engineers for EFM32 and EFR32 devices. These examples are categorized by technology. All examples provide a .sls file to easily import into Simplicity Studio. Additionally, each example will provide the source files and instructions to port the example to other parts. Unless otherwise specified in the directory, all examples are considered to be EXPERIMENTAL QUALITY which implies that the code provided in the repos has not been formally tested and is provided as-is.  It is not suitable for production environments.  In addition, this code will not be maintained and there may be no bug maintenance planned for these resources. Silicon Labs may update projects from time to time.

## Structure ##

- List all the sub-repositories, give the link and explain briefly what kind of project should be in each of them
- Using a table to do that - repo name - repo link - technology - description 

## How to contribute

- Using PR process to contribute
1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your fork to your local machine
3. Adding your project into separate folder, make sure to ...
4. Create a Pull Request (PR) and discribe your changes
5. Wait for feedback and get merged - normally it will take 5 working days ...

## Contribution Guidelines

- Introducing about CICD system:
  - Good pratices
    - Kind of project format
    - Folder structure
    - Documentation
    - [code_of_conduct](https://github.com/SiliconLabsSoftware/agreements-and-guidelines/blob/main/code_of_conduct.md)
    - [coding_standard](https://github.com/SiliconLabsSoftware/agreements-and-guidelines/blob/main/coding_standard.md)
  - PR checkings and how to use
    - Criteria to pass the PR checkings
    - How to access the report
    - If something wrong happens who/how to contact

  - Who is responsible for what (contributors, siliconlabs moderator - maybe our team)


## What's next?

- Maintenance activities
- Working with authors to port useful projects to AEP program

## Reporting Bugs/Issues and Posting Questions and Comments ##
